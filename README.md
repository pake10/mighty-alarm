# mighty-alarm

A humorous alarm clock utilizing some sensors (vibration, ...) and servos.
The only way to silence this clock is to knock on its door. However, there is a catch â€“ the proximity sensor ensures that you can't just go back to bed unless you are willing to hear its infernal uproar again and again!
