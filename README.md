A humorous alarm clock utilizing some sensors (ultrasonic distance sensor, piezo knock sensor), servos and a speaker.
The only way to silence this clock is to knock on its door. However, there is a catch â€“ the proximity sensor ensures that you can't just go back to bed unless you are willing to hear its infernal uproar again and again! (Well, three times to be precise.)
